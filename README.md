A simple, welcoming website for a small Christian house group based in Ash, Kent.

## About

This is a static website built for GitHub Pages, designed to provide information about the house group, upcoming events, and contact details.

## Features

- Clean, responsive design that works on all devices
- Information about the group
- Events calendar

- Accessibility-focused HTML structure
- QR code in footer for easy mobile access

## Deployment

This site is designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages. To deploy:

1. Go to your repository Settings
2. Navigate to "Pages" section
3. Under "Source", select the branch you want to deploy (e.g., `main` or `copilot/create-simple-website`)
4. Click Save
5. Your site will be available at `https://[username].github.io/ash-open-house-website/`

## Local Development

To view the site locally, simply open `index.html` in a web browser, or use a local server:

```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js (if you have npx)
npx serve
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Customization

To customize the website:

- Edit `index.html` to update content
- Modify `styles.css` to change colors, fonts, and layout
- Update event information in the Events section
- Change contact details in the Contact section

### Regenerating the QR Code

If you need to regenerate the QR code (e.g., after changing the website URL):

```bash
# Install required Python package
pip install qrcode[pil]

# Run the QR code generator script
python3 generate_qr_code.py
```

This will create/update the `website-qr-code.png` file that displays in the footer.
