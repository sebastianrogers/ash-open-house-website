                <h2>What's Open House all about?</h2>
                <div class="about-content">
                    <p>Ash Open House started during lockdown when all its participants were isolated in Ash! We started to meet online – partly to get to know new people with friends in common and partly because we all have an interest in Christianity. We come from a wide range of backgrounds and are not all regular church attendees.</p>
                    <p>Our aim is to help people connect with each other and Jesus as we explore together life's big questions.</p>
                    <p>Those of no faith, any faith and the undecided are welcome. Most especially those who wouldn't contemplate 'church' as they know it!</p>
                    <p>There's no preaching or sermons, instead we discuss, explore questions and mutually share about spirituality and following Jesus.</p>
                    <p>We meet regularly for social occasions, some bible study, walks in the Village and visits to other church or associated groups. We love to eat and laugh together and support each other through life's trials and joyful moments.</p>
                    <p>We meet in Ash, Kent in homes, the pub and anywhere we can get to chat. We are an open, inclusive community where newcomers feel valued and accepted.</p>
