                <h2>What's Open House all about?</h2>
                <div class="about-content">
                    <p>Ash Open House started during lockdown when all its participants were isolated in Ash! We started to meet online – partly to get to know new people with friends in common and partly because we all have an interest in Christianity. We come from a wide range of backgrounds and are not all regular church attendees.</p>
                    <p>Our aim is to help people connect with each other, have fun together, and explore together life's big questions and how Jesus fits into that.</p>
                    <p>Those of no faith, any faith and the undecided are welcome. Most especially those who wouldn't contemplate 'church' as they know it!  We love to share food and laugh together, and often end up going for a lunchtime curry, we’ve helped each other out with DIY and gone on lots of healthy walks across the fields.  We look at the bible, sometimes get together for a singalong and try to help out in the community and with each other whenever we can.  Other activities also come up: firework parties, Church groups on the beach – whatever takes our fancy!  We are there to support each other through life's trials and joyful moments. </p>
                    <p>We like a lively discussion, exploring some of life’s thorny questions together and mutually sharing our views on spirituality and following Jesus’s teachings.</p>
                    <p>We meet in Ash, Kent in homes, the pub and anywhere we can get to chat. We are an open, inclusive community where we aim to make newcomers feel valued and accepted.</p>
